# CryptoCommerce

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**CryptoCommerce** is a decentralized marketplace that enables users to buy and sell products using multiple cryptocurrency token standards: Ether (ETH), Fungible Tokens (FT - ERC20), and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT - ERC721). This platform leverages blockchain technology and smart contracts to facilitate secure, transparent, and trustless peer-to-peer commerce.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build a fully functional e-commerce marketplace where customers can transact with one another using ETH, ERC20 tokens, or NFTs, governed entirely by smart contracts. This ensures that all purchases, sales, and token transfers are handled securely and transparently on the Ethereum blockchain.
